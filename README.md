# Power-and-Energy
This includes the Simulink model for Closed-loop control of Power injection into the grid from a controllable voltage source. I used an IEEE paper(refer the Reference2) to implement this problem and also adding that. To do so I have used closed-loop PI control using inputs and error from D-Q transform.
